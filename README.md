# WPICourse2Calendar
A script that takes in WPI course IDs and creates a .ics file for your calendar.

## How to use
 1. Make sure you have ruby 3.1 installed
 2. Edit the course_sections.txt file. For each course you want to add to your calendar, add its course code on a new line in the format "DepartmentID CourseNumber-Term/semester" (Ex: AB 1533-C01)
 3. Run the project. In the project directory enter `ruby WPICourse2Calendar.rb` into the terminal
 4. Your calendar file will be saved as Course_Schedule.ics, where you can open it or import it into any calendar application
